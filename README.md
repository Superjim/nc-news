# NC-News

## About

NC-News is a backend service built as part of a week-long project for my Northcoders bootcamp. It mimics the functionality of a real-world service such as Reddit, providing information to the front-end architecture. With this API, you can access a variety of news topics, registered users, and articles, and perform various actions such as sorting, ordering, and filtering. With the instructions provided in this README, you will be able to set up and run the project locally, and begin experimenting with the available routes and features.

## Deployment

This project is currently deployed at https://nc-news-6g30.onrender.com. You can access the deployed API by making requests to this URL.

The project is deployed using the latest version of my github projects main folder.

If you would like to deploy the project yourself locally, you can do so by following the instructions in the "To setup and run this project locally" section of this README, or [**skip ahead to the routes**](##-6.-Routes)

### To setup and run this project locally:

## 1. Clone this repository and open the root directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Superjim/nc-news
```

```bash
cd nc-news
```

## 2. Create .env files

Create two .env files, .env.test and .env.development in the nc-news directory.

In the .env.test file, you should add the following line:

```
PGDATABASE=nc_news_test
```

In the .env.development file, add the following:

```
PGDATABASE=PGDATABASE=nc_news
```

## 3. Install dependencies

The minimum version of **Node.js** required to run this project is 6.0.0, as it is written in ES6, however I recommend using the latest long term support version. You can get this from https://nodejs.org.

Once you have Node.js installed, type this in the terminal to install the following required dependencies for the project:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run setup-dbs
```

```bash
npm run seed
```

## 5. Start the application

To start the application on the default port 9090, type the following in the terminal:

```bash

```

## 6. Routes

Using an application such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) you can query the database.

If you have setup the project locally, you can use the address http://localhost:9090/ along with the route.

The application is also deployed online using Render at the address https://nc-news-6g30.onrender.com.
